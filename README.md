# Deep Learning Based Predictive Model for Customer Conversion
## Description:
Developed a deep learning algorithm to predict customer conversion for audiobook purchases after receiving promotional emails. The project involved collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing customer data to build a predictive model that identifies potential buyers.

## Workflow:
**Data Collection:** Gathered customer data including past purchase history, engagement metrics, and demographic information.
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and scaled the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. Handled imbalanced data by equalizing the number of positive and negative targets.
**Model Building:** Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to design and train a neural network model. The model included multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and an output layer with softmax activation for classification.
**Model Saving:** Saved the trained model using the Keras format to ensure compatibility and ease of use for future predictions.
**Prediction:** Applied the model to new customer data to predict the likelihood of conversion. The model outputs the customer IDs of those likely to purchase after receiving a promotional email.

## Technical Skills:
**Programming Languages:** Python
**Libraries and Frameworks:** NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda
**Techniques:** Data Preprocessing, Neural Networks, Model Training, Model Evaluation, Data Scaling, Imbalanced Data Handling

## Achievements:
Successfully identified high-potential customers for targeted promotional campaigns, leading to improved marketing efficiency and increased sales.
Demonstrated the ability to handle end-to-end machine learning workflows, from data collection to model deployment.
